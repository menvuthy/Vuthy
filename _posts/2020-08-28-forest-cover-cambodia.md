# Forest Cover in Cambodia: 2000 - 2019

Forest cover plays an essential role in delivering important ecosystem services, including biodiversity richness, climate regulation, carbon storage, and water supplies (1). However, spatially and temporally detailed information on global-scale forest cover changes at a high resolution did not exist until M.C. Hansen and his team in the University of Maryland, USA developed a global-scale forest change and published the works in 2013 (2). Hansen et al (2) mapped global tree cover extent, loss, and gain annually for the period from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 m, especially the datasets have been updated every year. Therefore, here I illustrate the remote sensing method to extract the datasets of global-scale forest cover to:

1. Visualize the global forest cover in 2019 and forest cover loss since 2000 until 2019. 
2. Examine the spatial and temporal changes of forest cover in Cambodia from 2000 to 2019.
3. Calculate the yearly forest loss in Cambodia from 2000 to 2019.

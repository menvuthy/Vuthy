Heavy rain lashed Cambodia for over two weeks in October 2020, flooding 18 provinces and Phnom Pench city. According to figures reported by National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) in Cambodia from 1st to 19th October, 25 people were reported dead in the floods, about 300,000 people or 78,000 families were affected, and about 37,000 people or 9,000 families were displaced to safer zones. In addition, flood has also destroyed 56 houses and affected over 73,000 houses, while 568 schools were inundated. In this flood event, at least 80,000 ha crops and 210,000 ha paddy fields were inundated, whereas theirs damages has not been so far reported. On the other hand, many national and provincial roads were severely impacted by the effects of this prolonged flood.

{% include gallery caption="Figure 1: Report and data summary on flood impact in 2020 in Cambodia." %}

Even though various data were collected and described in Figure 1 by NCDM, the area of flooding which shows the extend and location of flooding has remained unofficially published by any related institutions. Therefore, I would like to reveal a quick method to detect and extract the inundated area based on Sentinel-1 SAR GRD images by using Google Earth Engine in QGIS application. The objectives are as follows:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

1. Visualize the Sentinel-1 SAR GRD images of Cambodia from 15th to 20th October 2020 which is the most servere flooding period in the region. 
2. Detect inundation area in the images by setting a specific threshold value for waterbody.
3. Extract and export the image of inundation area as a GeoTIFF or Raster format from the cloud storage of Google Earth Engine.

## Methodology

Visualizing the Sentinel-1 SAR images, dectecting waterbody, and extracting it for other analysis can be performed in Google Earth Engine and QGIS by using EE Python API. Therefore, it is important to equip with some background on programming language and QGIS application. Below, I will instruct a few steps on how to visualize the images, detect waterbody and extract inundation area for other computation and analysis.

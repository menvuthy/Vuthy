## Introduction
Rice crops are mainly categorized into early, medium and late variety, and they are differently damaged by flood depending on its growth characteristic, productivity, and value.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include gallery caption="Figure 1. Growth duration and growth stage of early, medium and late rice crops by phase [1]." %}

However, the estimation method of flood damage based on rice crop types remains unexamined in previous studies due to the shortage of past damage data and intensive field survey with local farmers, especially with those who experienced the past flood events. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}


Hence, this study attempts to 

1. develop the assessment methodology to estimate the flood damage on early, medium and late rice crops based on flood depth and flood duration through development of:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

* Three Types of Flood Depth-duration and damage Curves (3-Type FDCs) according to field survey with farmers in the flood-affected area.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
* paddy area map of early, medium and late rice crop by using MODIS satellite imagery.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

2. Assess the flood damage on rice crops under the past and the present cropping patterns and analyze the impact of different flood frequencies.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

3. Assess the flood damage on rice crops under the present climate (1979-2003) and future climate (2075-2099) conditions, based on MRI-AGCM3.2S precipitation datasets from previous study [2].
{: style="text-align: justify;"}


This study enriches more understanding on how early, medium and late rice crops are damaged by floodwater with the function of flood depth and flood duration. The assessment method can be applied in other areas; mainly, in the area with scarce data. It also provides essential information about the areas of risk which can be useful for future development activities; particularly, for establishing a flood mitigation policy and strategy for climate change adaptation.

## Study Area and Field Survey

* **Study Area**
Pursat province is located at the Southwest of Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia. It is known as one of the most vulnerable provinces to flood disasters in the country.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="Figure 2. Location of study area and annual rice production in Pursat Province." %}

* **Field Survey**
Target locations: villages which are located in the flood plain areas and in each districts.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Figure 3. Location of study area and annual rice production in Pursat Province." %}

Target farmers: those who had experienced the rice crop damages caused by flood disasters. Flood depth and duration in their rice fields, and damage of their rice production were focused.

## Methodology

Visualizing the Sentinel-1 SAR images, dectecting waterbody, and extracting it for other analysis can be performed in Google Earth Engine and QGIS by using EE Python API. Therefore, it is important to equip with some background on programming language and QGIS application. Below, I will instruct a few steps on how to visualize the images, detect waterbody and extract inundation area for other computation and analysis.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**1. Visualizing the Sentinel-1 SAR GRD images**

The platform to run the script is [CodeGEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com). Filter the collection of Sentinel-1 SAR GRU images for the VV and VH product from the descending track. Filter the date of interest, and add image layer into the map by clipping only Cambodia boundary. Here I used only VV products to analyze the waterbody. VH product can also be used; however, threshold value for determining the waterbody may be slightly different from VH product.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

```yaml
---
// Load country features from Large Scale International Boundary (LSIB) dataset.
var countries = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017');
var roi = countries.filter(ee.Filter.eq('country_co', 'CB'));
Map.addLayer(roi,{},'Cambodia')

//Let's centre the map view over our ROI
Map.centerObject(roi, 6);

// Filter the collection for the VV product from the descending track
var collectionVV = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq('instrumentMode', 'IW'))
    .filter(ee.Filter.listContains('transmitterReceiverPolarisation', 'VV'))
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq('orbitProperties_pass', 'DESCENDING'))
    .filterBounds(roi)
    .select(['VV'])
    .median();

// Filter the collection for the VH product from the descending track
var collectionVH = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq('instrumentMode', 'IW'))
    .filter(ee.Filter.listContains('transmitterReceiverPolarisation', 'VH'))
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq('orbitProperties_pass', 'DESCENDING'))
    .filterBounds(roi)
    .select(['VH'])
    .median();

// Adding the VV layer to the map at a specific date
var image = ee.Image(collectionVV.filterDate('2020-10-14', '2020-10-20').median());
Map.addLayer(image.clip(roi), {min: -25, max: 5}, 'Image_VV');
---
```

**2. Detecting inundation area**

The threshold value to differentiate the waterbody from the image is determined from the value of frequency value of VV. The value in the first peak area are generally considered as water value, while other high frequency value represents other types of classification including building, road, bared soil, crops, and forest. In order to compute, the scale should be set based on the size of the region of interest. The smaller the ROI is, the smaller the scale is. In the Cambodia scale, 500 resolution is set due to the fact that the higher resolution might not work due to the limition in GEE cloud when it comes to exporting.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

```yaml
---
// Compute the histogram of the Image
var histogram = image.reduceRegion({
  reducer: ee.Reducer.histogram(255, 2)
      .combine('mean', null, true)
      .combine('variance', null, true), 
  geometry: roi, 
  scale: 500,
  bestEffort: true
});

// Chart the histogram
print(Chart.image.histogram(image, roi, 500));
---
```
{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="Figure 15: Histogram of VV showing the value for different type of landuse." %}

**3. Extract and export the image of inundation area**

The image pixels are classified as waterbody where theirs VV values are less than the threshold defined in Step 2, and the classified area can be extracted by masking the non-water area and clipped for Cambodia boundary. The classified image can be then exported as GeoTIFF by setting high maxPixels following the size of the region of interest. By running the code below in GEE, the result of inundation area as GeoTIFF file will be stored in the Google drive.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Notice:** The smaller scale, the higher maxPixels.
{: .notice--success}

```yaml
---
// Chart the histogram
print(Chart.image.histogram(image, roi, 500));

// Classify the Image
var flood = image.lt(-15);
Map.addLayer(flood.mask(flood).clip(roi), {palette: 'blue'}, 'Flood');

Export.image.toDrive({
  image: flood.mask(flood).clip(roi),
  description: 'FloodMap_2',
  scale: 10,
  region: roi,
  maxPixels:4000000000000
});
---
```

**Notice:** In order to achieve similar result in QGIS, the script described above shall be converted into EE Python API.
